### comparing fine tuning transfer learning, and training from scratch across CNN architectures like resnet50, mobilenet_v3 and vgg16  

done:
- trying fine tuning and transfer learning on resnet50

todo:
- make a pipeline for training and inference instead of 1 giant notebook
- try mobilenet_v3 and vgg16 implementation then compare all models and training approaches
- maybe add a user friendly interface
